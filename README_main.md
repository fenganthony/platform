# üß™ Platform Engineer Homework

## üìå Objective

This homework is designed to evaluate your ability to deploy, monitor, and operate a Java-based application on Kubernetes using Helm and diagnostic tools. You will simulate a production scenario where a service becomes unresponsive due to internal thread contention. Your task is to make it observable, recoverable, and operationally safe.

---

## üß± Provided Application

You are given a prebuilt Java Spring Boot application (or can build it yourself from `Dockerfile`) with the following behavior:

- Exposes a simple `/hello` endpoint on port `8080`
- After **100 seconds**, a background thread acquires a lock and enters an **infinite wait**
- All future `/hello` requests become **blocked** due to synchronization on the same lock
- The app **does not crash**, and logs show no error
- The issue is only observable via degraded latency or hanging requests

---

## ‚úÖ Your Tasks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Helm Chart Setup (**45 points**)

Design and submit a Helm chart that includes:

- `Deployment.yaml` with proper probes and resource settings
- `Service.yaml` to expose the application
- `Ingress.yaml` for `/hello` routing
- `values.yaml` to allow configurability
- Liveness/readiness probes that eventually detect `/hello` is unresponsive and restart the container

Your values.yaml must support configuration flexibility. The following are required or recommended:

| Key                      | Type   | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image.repository`       | string | Docker image repo                                                            |
| `image.tag`              | string | Image version                                                                |
| `resources`              | object | CPU/memory requests & limits                                                 |
| `ingress.enabled`        | bool   | Whether to create an ingress                                                 |
| `service.type`           | string | ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer                                         |
| `probes.enabled`         | bool   | Whether to enable liveness/readiness probes                                  |
| `jvmExporter.enabled`    | bool   | Whether to enable jmx-exporter sidecar (if implemented)                      |
| `jvmExporter.crdInstall` | bool   | ‚ö†Ô∏è If jmx-exporter CRD is required (e.g. for ServiceMonitor), allow toggling |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Restart Thread Dump Capture (**20 points**)

Before the container is restarted, you must:

- Use `jstack` (or equivalent) to dump the JVM thread stack
- Save the output to the **Kubernetes node's local disk**
- Path format (example): `/var/log/java-dump/<pod-name>.log`

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Basic JVM Observability (**15 points**)

Enhance observability by:

- Adding `jmx_exporter` or similar
- Exposing JVM thread/GC metrics via Prometheus
- (Optional) Showing how alerts can be defined for thread blocking

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD Pipeline (**20 points**)

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Builds the Java app into a Docker image
- Pushes it to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry
- (Optional) Validates Helm templates or performs dry-run deploys

> Place your workflow in `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`

---

## üîç Reasonability Review

All requirements are considered **realistic and production-relevant** for a Platform Engineer:

| Area                    | Justification                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Helm templating         | Industry standard for Kubernetes deployments                                  |
| Probes & resource limits| Essential for platform-managed app health and autoscaling                    |
| Pre-restart diagnostics | Required in real-world SRE/on-call workflows                                 |
| JVM observability       | Crucial for diagnosing GC/Thread contention in production Java systems        |
| CI/CD pipeline          | Demonstrates automation readiness and delivery process awareness              |

## üìù Deliverables

1. A GitHub repository containing:
   - Helm chart (`charts/java-app/`)
   - Sample `values.yaml`
   - Optional: `.github/workflows/` CI/CD workflow
   - README explaining how to test, deploy, and analyze
2. Logs and dumps outputted by the app `logs/<pod-name>.log`
3. A short `SUMMARY.md` with:
   - Your design decisions
   - Any assumptions or limitations
   - What you‚Äôd improve in a production version

## üë§ Notes for Non-Java Engineers

If you're not familiar with Java debugging tools:

- Most JDKs support:
  ```bash
  jps           # Lists JVM PIDs
  jstack <pid>  # Dumps thread state
  ```

- If unavailable, you may:
  - Use `/proc/<pid>/stack`
  - Use a debugging sidecar container with tools installed
  - Inject `openjdk` tooling via a custom image

Clearly explain your intent if you're unable to implement full tooling ‚Äî **communication and reasoning are more important than completeness**.

## üß† Scoring Summary

| Section                                  | Points |
|------------------------------------------|--------|
| Helm chart (Deployment, Service, Ingress)| 45     |
| Pre-restart stack dump to node log       | 20     |
| JVM observability (Prometheus, exporter) | 15    |
| CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)          | 20    |
| **Total**                                | **100** |

## üöÄ Testing Instructions

The following `Makefile` commands are available to simplify Docker-based development and testing:

| Command           | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make build`     | Build the Docker image using the specified image name and tag |
| `make run`       | Run the container locally, exposing it on port 8080         |
| `make stop`      | Stop the running container                                  |
| `make logs`      | Stream logs from the container                              |
| `make push`      | Push the built image to your Docker registry                |
| `make clean`     | Remove the local Docker image                               |

> Default image: `yourname/spring-hello-problem:1.0.0`  
> Exposed port: `8080`

```bash
# After deploying via Helm:
curl http://<your-ingress-host>/hello

# ‚úÖ Initial behavior:
# You should see: "Hello World"

# üïí After ~100 seconds:
# The endpoint will hang due to a background thread holding a global lock.
# You should begin seeing timeouts or delayed responses.

# üß™ Next:
# - Use jstack to inspect thread state
# - Save the output to /var/log/java-dump/<pod-name>.log on the node
# - Observe probe-triggered restarts if implemented
```

## üçÄ Good luck!

We're not evaluating how well you write Java ‚Äî  
We're evaluating **how well you deploy, diagnose, and recover black-box applications in production**.

Show us your thought process, observability design, and operational maturity.

We‚Äôre excited to see your engineering judgment in action!
